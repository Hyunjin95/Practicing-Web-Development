# Web Design Guideline

The list below is a summarization of the lecture, [Web Design for Web Developers]("https://www.udemy.com/course/web-design-secrets/"), on Udemy.

## Typography

- Use a font-size between **15 and 25** pixels.

- Use a **(really) big font-size** for `headlines`. Typically between **32px and 60px**.

> If you want to use extremely big font sizes (Ex: 90px), decrease the font weight.

- Use line spacing between **120 and 150%**.

- **45 to 90** characters per line.

- Use good fonts.

> Sans-serif: No serif. More neutral. Clean. Simple. Modern websites. Ex) Open Sans, Lato, Raleway, Monsterrat, PT Sans
>
> Serif: Traditional purposes. Storytelling. Long reading. Ex) Cardo, Merriweather, PT Serif

- Choose a font which reflects **the look and feel you want** for your website.

- Use only **one font** (especially for beginner).

## Colors

- Use only **one base color**.

> You can also create the dark or the lighter version of the base color.

- Use a **tool** if you want to use **more colors**.

- Use color to **draw attention**.

- **Never use black** in your design.

- Choose colors widely.

## Images

- Put text **directly** on the image.

> Use this approach when the image is dark and the text is white, or vice versa.

- **Overlay** the image.

- Put your text **in a box**.

> Boxes should be transparent to an extent.

- **Blur** the image.

- The **floor fade**.

> It means the image fades toward black at the bottom, with white text written over it.

## Icons

- Use icons to **list features/steps**.

- Use icons for **actions and links**.

- Icons should be easily **recognizable**.

- **Label** your icons.

- Icons should **not** take a **center stage**.

> They should play a supporting rule.

- Use **icon fonts** (vector icons) whenever possible.

## Spacing and Layout

- Use **whitespace**.

> Put whitespace between elements, groups of elements and website's sections.
>
> But, do not exaggerate.

- Define **hierarchy**.

> Whitespace describes invisible relationships between the elements of your website.
>
> Steps:
>>
>> 1. Define where you want your audience to look first.
>>
>> 2. Establish a flow corresponds to your content's message.
>>
>> 3. Use whitespace to build that flow.

## User Experience

`User Interface` is the presentation of a product, **how it looks** and feels.

`User Experience` is **the overall experience** the user has with a product. It includes User Interface.

> "It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

- Grab your user's **attention**.

- Tell your user **the benefit**.

- Do **not** ask for **too much information**.
